## My Approach 

### 1. Feature list
Using Trello I created a checklist of the requirements and then some initial ideas I had for things to add. This let me keep on top of production against the deadline and quickly capture/prioritize new ideas while I was working. 

#### Key Features
* Give users the option to create a garden 
* Give users the option to create a garden 
* Give users the option to create a garden 
* Create a custom and dynamic responsive layout 
* Add CSS Animations throughout
* Add Open Graph and Twitter assets for sharing to social media

### 2 â€” Research
I knew from the beginning that one of the key areas I wanted to play with was the design and keep it within family of the existing brand. This way the nomination site would have the trust of the Shopify brand and the winner would carry more impact. (Plus I really love the branding and wanted an opportunity to apply it in a project.) 

The first places I checked were the [Shopify marketing site](https://shopify.com/) and the [Polaris design system site](https://polaris.shopify.com/). These were valuable to see what sort of layouts, color and typograpy were used. I also took note of the style of copywriting for main service page headlines and how there was an engaging theme of elements overlaying into other sections, breaking the grid.

I also attended a webinar hosted by Shopify that had 5 panelists talk about the application proccess, but more importantly how they approach design and development at Shopify. Being able to learn the context of projects was really important to them and being in a growth mindset. 4 months as intern goes by fast and they mentioned how important it was to take in as much as possible. 

This webinar helped validate for me that applying the context of the exiting brand would be a good direction and that showcasing the ability to adapt to new tech would also work in my favor. 

### 3 â€” Creating a new design 
Now that I had a feature list and design direction I leveraged Figma for the next stage of planning. Since I was going to build this application with React, I created a "React Component Flow" that showed what components would be needed and how they would be structured. This also made it easier later on the create the folder structure and quickly brainstorm when a new component was needed. 

Next I created the user interface that was tied to a design system. The design system held styles for typography and colors. It also housed Figma components that were built with Auto Layout and Variants. 

Creating these design assets upfront made the coding a lot easier, as many problem could be identified and solved in this initial stage.

### 4 â€” Development 
At this stage I had everything I needed to start coding and the above resources proved helpful throughout development. I decided on building the site in React and use Redux, SASS and CSS Animations to support it. These 3 technologies are all areas I can improve in and I wanted this project to be catalyst for growth, even whether it helps earn the internship or not.
